# thymeleaf-store
In order to learn thymeleaf, I decided to create this simple store to manage general products. It's an application in which I tried to implement everything I learned about the library.

## Configuration
* On root folder, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the database.
* Run `mvn clean install` to build the project.
* Run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the project.
